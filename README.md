# website-project
It's a simple website to learn basics of HTML and CSS using various sources of information.
The goal is to create a webpage to show public domain books.

## Current objectives
- [x] Create a homepage
- [x] Create about
- [ ] Apply a quality visual style
- [ ] Publish on github pages
- [ ] Build up a responsive design
- [ ] Share it!

I pick up the idea from this [github](https://github.com/melanierichards/just-build-websites#ideas-for-web-design--dev-projects) ("Create a fan site (and maybe an old-school web forum) for something you love") that was redirect by this [one](https://github.com/alinebastos/dev-practice#-ideas)
